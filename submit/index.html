<p class="text-align-center"><strong>Thank you for your interest in <cite>The Lark</cite>!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Submissions are currently closed</strong>, due to a lack of financial support for the journal&mdash;the ability to pay artists for their work was fundamental to the vision of <cite>The Lark</cite>, and without this capacity, the editors* feel it is inappropriate to continue publishing.</p>
<p>However, some things are allowed to exist, radiantly, in a moment in time, and make no demands on continued, chronological presence&hellip;.</p>
<p>To that end, we hope that you are able to behold what is present here, to chew on it, to speak with it, to be in continued conversation with it, without the ability, for the time being, to expand its edges.</p>
<p>If you have any inquiries about the current imaginings of <cite>The Lark</cite>, contact <a href="mailto:editor@the-lark.net">editor@the-lark.net</a>.</p>
